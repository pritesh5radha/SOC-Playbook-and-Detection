Task 1: Introduction to Network Security Basics 
Objective: Understand the basics of network security by learning about different types of network threats and how to implement basic security measures. This task will introduce me to the foundational concepts of securing a small network. 
Skills: Basic Network Security, Threat Identification, Security Best Practices 
Tools: Firewall (Windows Defender Firewall or a basic hardware firewall), Wireshark 
Guidelines:The 
1. Learn Network Security Concepts: 
o Research and summarize different types of network threats, including viruses, worms, trojans, and phishing attacks. 
o Understand basic security concepts like firewalls, encryption, and secure network configurations. 
  
2. Implement Basic Security Measures: 
o Set up a simple network environment, such as your home network or a virtual lab with a router and one or two connected devices. 
o Enable and configure a basic firewall (e.g., Windows Defender Firewall) to block unauthorized access. 
o Set up basic security configurations, such as changing default passwords and enabling network encryption (WPA2 or WPA3). 
3. Monitor Network Traffic: 
o Use Wireshark to capture and analyse network traffic. 
o Identify different types of traffic, such as HTTP, DNS, and others, and understand what they mean. 
o Learn how to spot unusual or suspicious traffic that might indicate a security threat. 
4. Document Findings: 
o A summary of the network threats you researched. 
o The security measures you implemented and why. 
o Screenshots or descriptions of the traffic you captured with Wireshark. 
o A discussion on how these basic security measures help protect the network. 
5. Reflect on Security Best Practices: 
o Consider what additional security measures could be implemented in a larger, more complex network. 
o Write a short paragraph on how i would educate others about the importance of network security in everyday use.  
  
Task 2: Introduction to Web Application Security 
Objective: Learn about common web application vulnerabilities by analysing a simple web application. This task will help you understand how attackers can exploit weaknesses in web applications. 
Skills: Basic Web Security, Vulnerability Identification 
Tools: OWASP ZAP, WebGoat (or another vulnerable web application) 
Guidelines: 
1. Setup: 
o Install and set up WebGoat or another intentionally vulnerable web application on your local machine. 
o Ensure you understand how the application works and how to access it. 
2. Perform Basic Vulnerability Analysis: 
o Use OWASP ZAP to scan the web application for vulnerabilities. 
o Focus on identifying at least one instance each of SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). 
3. Explore Vulnerabilities: 
o Understand how each vulnerability works by reading the descriptions provided by OWASP ZAP. 
o Attempt to manually exploit these vulnerabilities using basic techniques (e.g., inserting SQL code in a login form). 
4. Report: 
o Document each vulnerability found, including how you discovered it and why it is dangerous. 
o Provide screenshots and a brief explanation of the exploitation process. 
o Suggest simple steps that could mitigate these vulnerabilities.
